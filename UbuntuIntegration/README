# this python script demonstrates six key features of Ubuntu Integration:
# 1: AppIndicator (the top right panel)
# 2: NotifyOSD (notification popup bubbles)
# 3: Unity Launcher Progress (the progress bar on the icon)
# 4: Unity Launcher Badge Counts (the numbers on icons)
# 5: Unity Launcher Dynamic QuickLists
# 6: Unity Launcher Urgency Notification

# first things first, we need to set up a .desktop file to use on the unity launcher
# take the entire contents here, paste them into a file, uncomment the lines
# note that the first line must remain commented to be a she-bang
# the second code line is just a comment
# save the file at the above path
# then go to that folder in nautilus (you may need to ctrl-h in order to see the hidden .local folder)
# find this file and drag and drop it directly on to the unity launcher

# ****** START OF ~/.local/share/applications/test.desktop FILE CONTENTS ****** #

##!/usr/bin/env xdg-open
#
## note the above line (and this one) should remain commented
